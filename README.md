## Introduction

Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are critical in ensuring that a service meets the expected performance and reliability standards. Traditionally, SLOs are defined based on historical data and expert judgment. However, with the advent of AI and machine learning, we can leverage data-driven approaches to optimize these definitions, leading to more accurate and effective SLOs.

This notebook is structured to provide a step-by-step guide that is easy to follow and well-documented, making it accessible for operations professionals who have a basic understanding of data analysis and machine learning.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with this project, you need to install the required libraries. You can do this by running the following command in your Jupyter notebook:

```bash
%pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn tabulate
```

## Notebook Structure

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

1. **Generating Mock Data:** Creating realistic mock data for experimentation.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and understanding the data.
3. **Defining SLOs Without AI:** Explaining the traditional method of defining SLOs.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Creating and selecting features for SLO definitions.
5. **Anomaly Detection and Visualization:** Identifying and visualizing anomalies in the data.
6. **Model Selection and Training:** Using machine learning models for SLO optimization.
7. **Model Comparison:** Comparing the performance of different models.
8. **Define Optimal SLOs Using AI:** Presenting and justifying the final SLO definitions.
9. **Summary and Conclusion:** Summarizing the findings and suggesting areas for further improvement.

## Key Features

- **Mock Data Generation:** Simulates real-world scenarios for testing and validation.
- **EDA and Visualization:** Provides insights into the data with comprehensive visualizations.
- **Traditional and AI-based SLO Definition:** Compares traditional methods with AI-based optimization.
- **Feature Engineering:** Enhances predictive power of machine learning models.
- **Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning:** Identifies the best models and optimizes their performance.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Detects and visualizes anomalies in the data.

## Best Practices

In this project, we follow best practices in data science and machine learning to ensure robust, reliable, and reproducible results. This includes:

- **Data Preparation:** Handling missing values, normalizing data, and creating relevant features.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Using train-test split, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to optimize model performance.
- **Reproducibility:** Setting random seeds for reproducibility of results.

## Conclusion

Using AI to define SLOs provided a more refined and accurate understanding of the service's performance metrics. The AI-based approach captured complex patterns and relationships in the data that traditional methods might miss, leading to more realistic and achievable SLOs. This improvement can help drive better performance optimization and resource management, ultimately leading to higher quality service and better alignment with business objectives.

We hope this notebook serves as a useful guide for operations professionals looking to leverage AI for SLO optimization. Thank you for following along!
