    "## Importance of AI in Defining SLOs\n",
    "Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are critical in ensuring that a service meets the expected performance and reliability standards. Traditionally, SLOs are defined based on historical data and expert judgment. However, with the advent of AI and machine learning, we can leverage data-driven approaches to optimize these definitions, leading to more accurate and effective SLOs.\n",

    "This notebook is structured as follows:\n",
    "1. **Generating Mock Data:** Creating realistic mock data for experimentation.\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and understanding the data.\n",
    "3. **Defining the SLO without AI:** Explaining the traditional method of defining SLOs.\n",
    "4. **Feature Engineering:** Creating and selecting features for SLO definitions.\n",
    "5. **Model Selection and Training:** Using machine learning models for SLO optimization.\n",
    "6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the models.\n",

    "## Summary and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we have demonstrated the process of defining and optimizing Service Level Objectives (SLOs) using AI. We followed best practices in machine learning to ensure robust, reliable, and reproducible results. Here is a summary of the steps we took:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Steps\n",
    "1. **Generating Mock Data:**\n",
    "   - We generated realistic mock data to simulate real-world scenarios for SLO experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**\n",
    "   - We performed EDA to gain insights into the generated data, identify patterns, and detect outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Defining SLOs Without AI:**\n",
    "   - We defined SLOs based on traditional methods and evaluated the data against these thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "   - We created new features and transformed existing ones to improve the predictive power of our machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Anomaly Detection and Visualization:**\n",
    "   - We identified anomalies in the metrics and visualized them over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Selection and Training:**\n",
    "   - We selected appropriate machine learning models, performed hyperparameter tuning, and evaluated their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Model Comparison:**\n",
    "   - We compared the performance of different models using actual vs predicted plots and residual plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Define Optimal SLOs Using AI:**\n",
    "   - We used the best-performing models to define optimal SLOs and provided a rationale for the chosen thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Following Best Practices\n",
    "By following best practices in data preparation, model training, and evaluation, we ensured that our machine learning models are reliable and reproducible. This approach helps in obtaining accurate and actionable insights from the data, leading to better decision-making and improved service quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Using AI to define SLOs provided a more refined and accurate understanding of the service's performance metrics. The AI-based approach captured complex patterns and relationships in the data that traditional methods might miss, leading to more realistic and achievable SLOs. This improvement can help drive better performance optimization and resource management, ultimately leading to higher quality service and better alignment with business objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope this notebook serves as a useful guide for operations professionals looking to leverage AI for SLO optimization. Thank you for following along!"
